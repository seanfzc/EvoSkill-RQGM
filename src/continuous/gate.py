"""The quality gate: judge a candidate before it can graduate.

The gate enforces the one invariant continuous evolution cannot live without:
**a candidate never goes live on the strength of the episodes that created it.**
It is judged on a held-out *replay buffer* — episodes the candidate was not
distilled from — exactly as the batch loop scores on a validation set it never
proposed against.

Phase 3 ships the **surrogate verifier** evaluator (research direction A): an
isolated verifier agent synthesizes assertions from the candidate skill and the
held-out task descriptions and decides whether the skill is correct and
generalizable — no ground truth, no re-running the agent. The `GateEvaluator`
interface lets a shadow-re-eval evaluator drop in later without touching the
policy.
