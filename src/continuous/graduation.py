"""Graduate a passing candidate into the live skill library.

Graduation is the only step that changes the live library, so it is deliberate
and auditable:

1. Install the candidate's `SKILL.md` into `.claude/skills/<name>/`.
2. For a *merge* candidate, archive the originals it replaces (reversibly).
3. If a `ProgramManager` is supplied, snapshot the change as a `program/*` git
   branch — so every graduation is versioned and revertible, exactly like the
   batch loop's programs. (Branched from the current HEAD; it does NOT join the
   accuracy-based frontier, so continuous graduations never pollute the main
   loop's score ranking.)
4. Mark the candidate `graduated` in the buffer.

The `ProgramManager` is injected so the filesystem behaviour is unit-testable
without git, while a real-repo integration test exercises the branch path.
